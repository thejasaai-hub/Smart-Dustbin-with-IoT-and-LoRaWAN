# Smart Dustbin with IoT and LoRaWAN

## Overview
The **Smart Dustbin** project aims to improve waste management through real-time monitoring of waste levels and optimizing waste collection routes. This system utilizes IoT technology with LoRaWAN for long-range data transmission, enabling remote monitoring of dustbin fill levels. When the dustbin reaches a predefined capacity, a notification is sent to a central server via the Arduino IoT Cloud, allowing waste management authorities to plan and optimize collection schedules, reducing unnecessary collection trips and environmental impact.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Ultrasonic sensors measure the fill level of the dustbin and automatically open/close the lid using a servo motor.
- **Remote Alerts**: When the dustbin is full, alerts are sent via LoRaWAN to a central server, which notifies authorities through the Arduino IoT Cloud.
- **IoT Integration**: Data is transmitted to the Blynk IoT mobile application for real-time monitoring and notifications.
- **Environmental Impact**: Reduces unnecessary waste collection trips, saving fuel and reducing emissions.

## Components Used
- **ESP32**: Primary microcontroller for handling sensor data and controlling the servo motor.
- **LoRaWAN Modules**: Used for long-range communication to transmit data to the server.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures the distance to detect the fill level of the dustbin.
- **Servo Motor**: Opens and closes the lid of the dustbin based on the fill level.
- **MKR GPS Module**: Provides location data for each dustbin.
- **Arduino IoT Cloud**: Platform for remote monitoring and control.
- **Blynk IoT App**: Mobile application for real-time monitoring and alerts.

  - `Servo` for servo motor control.
  - `Ultrasonic` for ultrasonic sensor data.
  - `Arduino_MKRGPS` for GPS functionality.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thejasaai-hub/Smart-Dustbin-with-IoT-and-LoRaWAN
.git

2. **Upload Code**:

-Open PROJECT_CODE.txt in the Arduino IDE.
-Install the required libraries using the Library Manager.
-Upload the code to the ESP32.

3. **Setup Blynk IoT**:

-Configure the Blynk IoT app to work with the Arduino IoT Cloud, enabling it to receive notifications about the dustbin fill level.

### Testing and Validation

1. **Fill Level Detection**: The ultrasonic sensor accurately measures the dustbin fill level in real-time.
2. **Lid Operation**: The servo motor opens and closes the lid based on proximity sensor input, ensuring the dustbin is only open when necessary.
3. **Communication**: LoRaWAN modules successfully transmit data to the Arduino IoT Cloud, allowing real-time monitoring.
4. **Environmental Conditions**: The system was tested for reliability under various environmental conditions to ensure consistent operation.

### Results and Analysis

The Smart Dustbin system effectively automates the monitoring of waste levels and optimizes collection routes. By sending real-time notifications when the dustbin is full, the project demonstrates potential for reducing operational costs in waste management and minimizing environmental impact.

### Future Improvements

**Enhanced Connectivity**: Integrate other network protocols (such as Wi-Fi or cellular) for higher reliability in urban areas with limited LoRaWAN coverage.
**Additional Sensors**: Incorporate temperature and humidity sensors to provide more comprehensive environmental monitoring.
**Data Analytics**: Leverage historical data to predict waste accumulation patterns and further optimize collection routes.

### Conclusion
The Smart Dustbin project leverages IoT and LoRaWAN technology to enhance waste management efficiency by enabling real-time monitoring and remote notifications. This project represents a scalable, cost-effective solution for smart city initiatives focused on environmental sustainability.
